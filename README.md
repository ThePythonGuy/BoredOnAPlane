# BoredOnAPlane
This is a set of math programs that I work on periodically which I started when I was - you guessed it - bored on a plane.
## Descriptions
### Bored1.java
This application simply lists out all of the prime numbers up to and including a number provided by the user.
### Bored2.java
This application gives out a list of all the gaps between consecutive primes up to a number provided by the user, and then outputs the largest gap and where it occurred.
### Bored3.java
This application takes in a lower and upper bound and then runs the Collatz algorithm on all the numbers in that range, inclusive. The program prints out the steps and the number of steps.
For more on the Collatz conjecture, visit http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html
### Bored4.java
This application takes in an integer, which it sets as an upper bound on the denominator of a set of fractions. It then prints out all of the fractions that are fully reduced and have a denominator up to or including the upper bound.
### Bored5.java
This applet draws a Sierpinski triangle.
### Bored6.java
This applet draws a cool-looking square.
